GEN Z OPTIMIZATION RULES:
1. HOOK FIRST: Start with the most engaging/shocking/intriguing moment (3-second rule)
2. FAST PACING: Quick cuts, high energy, no slow moments
3. EMOTIONAL PEAKS: Prioritize clips with strong emotions (surprise, excitement, humor, awe)
4. VISUAL PUNCH: Bold visuals, contrast, movement, close-ups over wide shots
5. STORY ARC: Problem ‚Üí Solution or Before ‚Üí After in under 30 seconds
6. TRENDING ELEMENTS: Relatable scenarios, behind-the-scenes, transformations

SEQUENCING PRIORITIES:
1. STRONGEST HOOK (0-3s): Most attention-grabbing clip first
2. BUILD MOMENTUM (3-15s): Stack high-energy moments, no filler
3. CLIMAX/PAYOFF (15-25s): Biggest reveal, transformation, or emotional peak
4. STRONG CLOSE (25-30s): Memorable ending that drives action

VIRAL OPTIMIZATION CRITERIA:
- Exclude slow/boring content regardless of production value
- Prioritize authentic moments over polished scenes
- Focus on relatability and shareability
- Optimize for mobile viewing (vertical preferred)
- Create "binge-worthy" momentum that makes viewers rewatch

CONTENT STRATEGY:
- Transform brand messaging into story-driven content
- Make corporate content feel authentic and personal
- Focus on human moments and emotional connections
- Create curiosity gaps that drive engagement

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Your response MUST include EXACTLY these 7 fields or it will be rejected:
1. sequence - array of selected clip IDs
2. excluded_clips - array of rejected clips with reasons

IMPORTANT: This is landscape source content that will be adapted for TikTok. Score based on adaptability potential, not current format.

VIDEO DATA:
${JSON.stringify(tlAnalysis, null, 2)}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
Base your scores on the actual TwelveLabs data provided above. Use these specific data points:
- Video metadata: duration, resolution, fps, file_size
- Visual analysis: scenes, shots, people detection, text_in_video, logos, motion
- Audio analysis: transcription, audio_quality, sounds_detected, music, voice_analysis
- Semantic analysis: topics, categories, sentiment, emotions, highlights
- Temporal analysis: pacing, opening, closing
- Context analysis: suitable_for, platform_fit, editing_notes

Apply the 5 Core Scoring Dimensions (100-point weighted scale):

1. HOOK QUALITY & FIRST IMPRESSION MOMENTS (25 points)
Evaluate attention-grabbing moments that can serve as TikTok hooks (users decide within 2-3 seconds):

- Verbal Hook Strength (8 points): Compelling opening statements, questions, bold claims, suspenseful teasers
- Multiple Hook Opportunities (5 points): 3+ distinct moments that could serve as standalone hooks
- Emotional Triggers (4 points): Content evoking surprise, excitement, curiosity, strong emotional responses

2. CONTENT MODULARITY & SEGMENTATION POTENTIAL (20 points)
Assess how easily content can be broken into coherent, standalone short-form pieces:
- Natural Break Points (6 points): Clear transitions, topic shifts, narrative segments for clean cuts
- Self-Contained Moments (6 points): Segments that tell complete mini-stories without full context
- Sequence Independence (4 points): Individual segments working standalone while maintaining impact
- Density of Clippable Content (4 points): High ratio of usable moments relative to total video length

3. TIKTOK-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION ELEMENTS (20 points)

4. ENGAGEMENT & RETENTION FACTORS (20 points)
Measure elements that drive viewer retention and engagement for algorithm favorability:
- Pacing and Energy (6 points): Dynamic pacing, quick cuts, energy levels matching short-form preferences
- Watch Time Optimization (5 points): Content density encouraging full viewing of 15-60 second clips
- Interactive Elements (4 points): Elements encouraging comments, shares, user-generated responses
- Completion Rate Potential (5 points): Content structure encouraging viewers to watch clips entirely

5. VIRAL POTENTIAL & SHAREABILITY (15 points)

Calculate TOTAL SCORE: Sum all dimension scores (max 100 points)

SCORE INTERPRETATION:
90-100: Exceptional clipping potential - Multiple high-performing clips with minimal optimization
75-89: High potential - Strong foundation with some optimization needed
60-74: Moderate potential - Reasonable opportunities requiring strategic enhancement
45-59: Limited potential - Significant reworking needed
