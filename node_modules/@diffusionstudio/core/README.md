# Getting Started
`@diffusionstudio/core` is a 2D motion graphics and video rendering engine powered by WebCodecs. Developers commonly use it for video editing automations and to build editing [playgrounds/web apps](https://playground.diffusion.studio).

## Documentation
Explore the full documentation at [docs.diffusion.studio](https://docs.diffusion.studio/docs).

## Credits
This project owes much to [@Vanilagy's](https://github.com/Vanilagy) exceptional muxer implementations.

## Why Use Diffusion Studio
üíª 100% **client-side**<br/>
ü™Ω **Small bundle size** ‚Äì Only 75 KB with a single dependency<br/>
ü©∏ Blazingly **fast** WebCodecs renderer<br/>
ü¶æ **AI-first** architecture<br/>

## Getting Started
```sh
npm install @diffusionstudio/core
```

## Benchmarks
![Benchmarks](./assets/benchmarks.png)

## Basic Usage
Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the library:

```javascript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const url = 'https://diffusion-studio-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/videos/big_buck_bunny_1080p_30fps.mp4';

// create a video clip and trim it
const video = new core.VideoClip(url).subclip(0, '10s');

// create a text clip and add styles
const text = new core.TextClip({ 
  text: 'Bunny - Our Brave Hero', 
  position: 'center', 
  duration: '5s', 
  stroke: { color: '#000000' } 
});

const composition = new core.Composition(); // 1920x1080

// this is how to compose your clips
await composition.add(video);  // convenience function for 
await composition.add(text);   // clip -> layer -> composition

await new core.Encoder(composition).render('hello_world.mp4');
```

The API models the structure of conventional video editing applications like Adobe Premiere or CapCut, using a layer-based system. Each layer contains zero or more clips of a single type, arranged in ascending chronological order.

Layers are created implicitly with `composition.add(clip)`, but you can also create them manually:

```typescript
const layer = composition.createLayer();
await layer.add(text0);
await layer.add(text1);
await layer.add(text2);
...
```

## How Does Diffusion Studio Compare?

### Remotion
A React-based video creation tool that converts the DOM into videos. It‚Äôs beginner-friendly, allowing web developers to leverage their existing skills.

### Motion Canvas 
A standalone editor designed for high-quality animations. It features an imperative API, adding elements procedurally rather than relying on keyframes, making it ideal for detailed animations.

### Diffusion Studio
A video editing **library** rather than a framework with a visual interface. It‚Äôs lightweight, operates entirely on the **client-side**, and supports WebCodecs without relying on WebAssembly/ffmpeg. Ideal for integration into existing projects.

## Contributing

Currently, version ^2.0.0 is invite-only. You can request access on our Discord if you're interested in contributing. The source code for version ^1.0.0 is available in this repository.

## Current features
* **Video/Audio** trimming and offsets
* **Layering**
* **Splitting** clips
* **Html & Image** rendering
* **Relative** units (e.g. 80% clip height)
* **Shapes** (e.g., rectangles, circles)
* **Text** with multiple styles
* **Audio Visualization**
* High Quality **Captions**
* **Silence Removal** for audio
* Web & Local **Fonts**
* **Custom Clips**
* **Filters**
* **Masks**
* **Blending** modes
* **Keyframe** animations
  * **Numbers, Text and Colors**
  * **Easing** (ease in, ease out etc.)
  * **Extrapolation** `'clamp' | 'extend'`
* **Realtime playback**
* **Hardware accelerated** encoding via WebCodecs
* **Dynamic render resolution and framerate**

## Background

This project was initiated in March 2023 with the mission of creating a ‚Äúvideo processing toolkit for the era of AI.‚Äù As someone passionate about video editing for over a decade, the release of WebCodecs and WebGPU without feature flags in Chrome presented the perfect opportunity to build something new.

Traditional browser-based video editors rely on server-side rendering, requiring time-consuming uploads and downloads of large files. With WebCodecs, video processing can now be done directly in the browser, making it significantly faster and more efficient.

I‚Äôm excited to contribute to the next generation of video editing technology.
